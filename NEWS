		 CHANGES IN LICORS VERSION 0.1.1

NEW FEATURES

  - `data2LCs()` got an additional return argument specifying the original
  dimension of the (input) field.  This can then be used in other functions
  to reconstruct the field/state space given the estimates for i=1,...,N 

BUG FIXES

  - examples in `merge_states()` raised error in the CRAN Windows check
  since it called `dev.off()`.  Removed this line of code (and also removed
  `dev.off()` and some `par(op)` in other example code.
