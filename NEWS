     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  - now also supports plain time series ('space_dim = 0')
  - added 'predict.mixed_LICORS()' method
  - changed to sparse 'Matrix' format whenever possible in the 'weight.matrix'
  - changed naming convenstion for variabels from '_' separator to '.' separator; '_' is now exclusively 
    used in function names

BUG FIXES

  - fixed bugs in computing horizon from coordinates
  - cleaned up code for faster performance and better readability

    CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.5

BUG FIXES

  - 'compute_LC_coords()' now also works for 'space_dim = 2' 

    CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.1

NEW FEATURES

  - `data2LCs()` got an additional return argument specifying the original
  dimension of the (input) field.  This can then be used in other functions
  to reconstruct the field/state space given the estimates for i=1,...,N 

BUG FIXES

  - examples in `merge_states()` raised error in the CRAN Windows check
  since it called `dev.off()`.  Removed this line of code (and also removed
  `dev.off()` and some `par(op)` in other example code.
  
		 CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1

NEW FEATURES

  - first version of LICORS: its main functionality is the mixed LICORS EM algorithm (`mixed_LICORS()`) along
  with summary and plotting functions.
  Furthermore it includes several functions for data preparation and light cone model setup, as well as 
  utility functions to handle space-time coordinates.
